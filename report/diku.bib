@COMMENT{

    1. Everything outside a legal definition is a comment.
    2. When adding entries with multiple authors be sure to separate them with 
    the word 'and' or face regret. http://www.tex.ac.uk/FAQ-manyauthor.html
    3. To override the chosen citation style define a `shorthand` key.
    4. Curly braces `{` `}` seem to be more common than doublequotes.
    5. Doublequotes are cancer due to unholy interactions with special characters.
    6. Blank lines between entries makes vim actions like `=ip` easier.
