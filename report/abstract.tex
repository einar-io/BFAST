    \noindent First we port the existing \textsc{bfast} algorithm
    from Futhark keeping the translated code as close to the source as possible.
    
    \noindent Second we use validate our translation by leveraging the Futhark
    test framework.

    \noindent Third we apply various optimizations to improve both temporal
    locality by tiling and shared memory usage, and spatial locality by
    coalesced memory accesses using matrix transpositions. To apply these
    optimizations we use several transformations and code restructuring
    techniques including loop interchange,
    stripmining, loop distribution, hoisting and array expansion.

    \noindent Additionally, we provide benchmarks for our optimizations
    including regressions.
